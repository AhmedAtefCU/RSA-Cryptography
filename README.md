# RSA-Cryptography

This Python script demonstrates the RSA encryption and decryption algorithm, a widely used method for secure communication over the internet. RSA relies on the mathematical complexity of factoring large numbers to ensure that messages can be securely transmitted and received.

The script begins by generating public and private keys, which are used for encryption and decryption. It then takes a plaintext message as input, encrypts it using the public key, and decrypts it using the private key. Additionally, the script showcases how the modulus used in RSA can be factorized into its prime components, and it includes a brute-force method to find the private exponent, highlighting the importance of selecting large prime numbers for security.

This code serves as a practical example of how RSA encryption works, illustrating its key concepts and demonstrating its application in securing communication.
